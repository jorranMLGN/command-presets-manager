# Run Presets Bash Script

This Bash script provides a cross-platform GUI to manage and run custom shell commands with preset working directories. It uses Zenity on Linux and AppleScript on macOS, allowing you to add, remove, import, and save command presets with ease.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Interface:** Uses Zenity (Linux) or AppleScript (macOS) for dialogs.
- **Preset Management:** Save, import, and load command presets.
- **Custom Commands:** Easily add commands that run in specified directories.
- **Config Persistence:** Stores custom commands in `~/.custom_commands` and presets in `~/.command_presets`.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux:** Ensure [Zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/) is installed.
- **macOS:** No additional installation needed (uses built-in AppleScript).

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Ensure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x command-manager.sh
   ```
3. (Optional) Move the script to a directory in your PATH for easy access.
## Usage
Run the script directly from your terminal:
   ```bash
   ./command-manager.sh
   ```
### Alias
If you want to use a different command to start it, you can add an alias:
   ```bash
   gedit ~/.bashrc
   ```
Add this at the end of the file:
```
alias command-manager='/home/<full path to script>/command-manager.sh'
```
Open a new terminal session or type source ~/.bashrc in your terminal to apply.

Then simply type "command-manager" in your terminal to start the script from everywhere.

Follow the on-screen prompts to add, manage, or remove custom commands and presets.

Configuration
* Custom commands are stored in ~/.custom_commands.
* Presets are saved in the directory ~/.command_presets.
